<h3>Category Changes: <em>DICKROD</em> &amp; <em>BARB</em></h3>

<ol>
	<li>DICKROD — Replace <strong>W, L</strong> with <strong>QS</strong> (Sponsor: Cozzie)</li>
	<li>BARB — Replace <strong>SV</strong> with <strong>SV+HLD</strong> for one season (Sponsor: Moses)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Moses on <em>BARB</em></h3>

<p>The best closers remain the best RP even if you add holds in my experience, it just adds value to good non-closers vs shitty closers.</p>

<h3>Bobby’s response to <em>DICKROD</em> and <em>BARB</em></h3>

<p>My preference would be no changes in 2020. </p>

<p>But i don&#39;t really have any issue with adding an extra roster spot to keep up with MLB, so I&#39;d likely vote yes.</p>

<p>For BARB + DICKROD i do think we&#39;d be wise to alter pitcher scoring, but it&#39;s such a deep issue and so dependant on how the MLB continues to evolve, that i wonder if we dont know the best way forward on P categories. Holds are hella weird, especially in the first year of 3 batter minimums. Quality Starts are great, but we&#39;re in the era of the opener. So I worry that we&#39;d be replacing a problem with another problem, and might be best served to hold our dick(rod)s until an obvious better option emerges.</p>

<p>All that said I love the pitching side of the ball and would be stoked for less Luck to influence our P stats, so i could be persuaded.</p>

<h4>Hunter’s response to <em>DICKROD</em> and <em>BARB</em></h4>

<p>I am ok with the idea of holds, but I kind of think we are going down the same path as saves even. Like holds are still pretty situational, and their are soo many to get. Also I agree that maybe since people used a keeper to keep saves bros, maybe we shouldn&#39;t devalue them right before the draft...maybe we plan to address in August around keepers and see if we vote on a new RP format then? As for Dickrod....I dunno man. It&#39;s pretty hard to swallow </p>

<h4>Spencer on <em>DICKROD</em> and <em>BARB</em></h4>

<p>I&#39;m leaning against <em>DICKROD</em> because QS is milquetoast. Plus, I&#39;ve always appreciated how W &amp; L cut against each other. They penalize equally those who sit on their hands and those who pick up streamers for every day of the week. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a stronger case to replacing SV with SV+HLD. For one, MLB teams are moving away from traditional closer roles, why shouldn&#39;t we? With fewer shitty relievers in lineups, pitching would be more competitive across the board. Our lineups would be better too if we collectively spent less draft capital on explosive assets that won&#39;t be on my roster for more than a few months. Finally, elite closers are still the best assets in SV+HLD. Closers tend to have more reliable workloads and should continue to give owners big stats. </p>

<h4>Cozzie re: <em>DICKROD</em></h4>

<p>Hey FUCK you then. W-L stats are meaningless to starters.</p>

<h2>Roster Changes</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Change roster size from <strong>25</strong> to <strong>26</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>Hunter’s roster expansion rationale</h3>

<p>Rule proposal: &quot;Bend as the river in the valley&quot; I prepose we roll with the MLB and expand rosters to 26 for PFK rosters. It will mirror true mlb where they moved up from 25 man rosters. It also has some added bonus of helping some people who might have wanted a 2nd DL or other squeezes in the last couple of years. Just 1 extra homie that is your homie, you know? </p>
