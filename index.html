<h1>VOTER’S GUIDE TO PFK </h1>

<h2>Category Changes</h2>

<h4>DICKROD — Replace <strong>W, L</strong> with <strong>QS</strong> (Sponsor: Cozzie)</h4>

<h4>BARB — Replace <strong>SV</strong> with <strong>SV+HLD</strong> for the 2020 season.<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> (Sponsor: Moses)</h4>

<p>---</p>

<h3>Moses’s rationale for <em>BARB</em></h3>

<p>The pool of viable fantasy starting pitchers shrinks every year as teams are more and more likely to pull all but the best pitchers after two turns through the order, if they even use a traditional starter at all. Relief roles are also more fluid than ever, with more teams shuffling the back of the bullpen based on matchups and leverage rather than nailing their best reliever to the bench until the 9th inning. Wins, losses and saves are spread thinly across a huge population of pitchers, with only a few real difference makers in each category.</p>

<p>The solution: add a counting stat that helps reflect the radical strategic changes in baseball over the last five years and thus re-emphasizes filling our rosters with the best players in the game. Juice up a category that a handful of PFK teams freely concede by season&#39;s end. Open up more strategy and roster building choices for every manager. Reduce the outsized role that manager decisions and in-season trades have on relief pitcher value. OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE HOLD.</p>

<h3>Bobby’s response to <em>DICKROD</em> and <em>BARB</em></h3>

<p>My preference would be no changes in 2020. </p>

<p>But i don&#39;t really have any issue with adding an extra roster spot to keep up with MLB, so I&#39;d likely vote yes.</p>

<p>For BARB + DICKROD i do think we&#39;d be wise to alter pitcher scoring, but it&#39;s such a deep issue and so dependant on how the MLB continues to evolve, that i wonder if we dont know the best way forward on P categories. Holds are hella weird, especially in the first year of 3 batter minimums. Quality Starts are great, but we&#39;re in the era of the opener. So I worry that we&#39;d be replacing a problem with another problem, and might be best served to hold our dick(rod)s until an obvious better option emerges.</p>

<p>All that said I love the pitching side of the ball and would be stoked for less Luck to influence our P stats, so i could be persuaded.</p>

<h3>Hunter’s response to <em>DICKROD</em> and <em>BARB</em></h3>

<p>I am ok with the idea of holds, but I kind of think we are going down the same path as saves even. Like holds are still pretty situational, and their are soo many to get. Also I agree that maybe since people used a keeper to keep saves bros, maybe we shouldn&#39;t devalue them right before the draft...maybe we plan to address in August around keepers and see if we vote on a new RP format then? As for Dickrod....I dunno man. It&#39;s pretty hard to swallow </p>

<h3>Spencer on <em>DICKROD</em> and <em>BARB</em></h3>

<p>I&#39;m leaning against <em>DICKROD</em> because QS is milquetoast. Plus, I&#39;ve always appreciated how W &amp; L cut against each other. They penalize equally those who sit on their hands and those who pick up streamers for every day of the week. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a stronger case to replacing SV with SV+HLD. For one, MLB teams are moving away from traditional closer roles, why shouldn&#39;t we? With fewer shitty relievers in lineups, pitching would be more competitive across the board. Our lineups would be better too if we collectively spent less draft capital on explosive assets that won&#39;t be on my roster for more than a few months. Finally, elite closers are still the best assets in SV+HLD. Closers tend to have more reliable workloads and should continue to give owners big stats. </p>

<h3>Cozzie re: <em>DICKROD</em></h3>

<p>Hey FUCK you then. W-L stats are meaningless to starters.</p>

<h2>Roster Changes</h2>

<h4>Expand rosters from <strong>25</strong> to <strong>26</strong> (Sponsor: Hunter)</h4>

<p>---</p>

<h3>Hunter’s rationale</h3>

<p>Rule proposal: &quot;Bend as the river in the valley&quot; I prepose we roll with the MLB and expand rosters to 26 for PFK rosters. It will mirror true mlb where they moved up from 25 man rosters. It also has some added bonus of helping some people who might have wanted a 2nd DL or other squeezes in the last couple of years. Just 1 extra homie that is your homie, you know? </p>

<h3>Commissioner’s note on potential impact</h3>

<p>I haven’t received any counterarguments, so I’ll just play devil’s advocate. In my view, expanding rosters could create some disparity in the league. Bad managers and prospect hoarders may be tempted use the extra roster spot on a stash while their overlords add another starter or reliever to their already stacked pitching staffs. </p>

<h2>Deadlines </h2>

<h4><em>COVFEFE </em> — Move keeper deadline from the Sunday after the trade deadline to August 31 (Sponsor: Spencer)</h4>

<h3>Spencer’s rationale</h3>

<p>I’ve always been a fan of omitting September call-ups from keeper lists. The “No September Covfefe” rule thickens the next year’s draft pool, and creates two classes of prospect, a fun wrinkle — Those who can be kept from day one and those who cannot. </p>

<p>Over the last few years, it seems like the keeper deadline has moved up and up. Last year it was August 18. Unless amended, this year’s will be August 16. </p>

<p>If the original intent was to prevent September call-ups from being kept, why are we shorting ourselves two extra weeks? Why not let the wick burn all the way to September?</p>

<p>That’s why I’m proposing to decouple the keeper and trade deadlines. I can hear your criticism already. “It’s going to be too confusing and hard to remember.” If we picked a random date or day of the week that may be true. </p>

<p>But for my money, the simplest thing to do would be to set the keeper deadline to August 31, the last day of the month. A vote in favor would give you get an extra week or two to assess your roster, navigate an injury, or wait for that killer prospect to debut. </p>

<h3>Bobby’s response </h3>

<p>I’m an early keeper deadline fan. I&#39;d move it earlier if we could, while still keeping it after the trade deadline.</p>

<p>I like the concept of committing to your guys early. It makes it less about &quot;roster maximization&quot; and more about scouting eye, projections, and gut feeling. There wouldn&#39;t have been any worthwhile prospects made keeper eligible by moving the deadline to aug 31 last year, so that&#39;s not a concern. A later deadline does give some relief to injury, but injuries happen during the playoffs and offseason too, so that&#39;s slippery.</p>

<p>As with all rule change stuff, I&#39;m more than happy to bend if this is what the majority wants. I personally enjoy the fact that our keeper deadline is brutally challenging.</p>
